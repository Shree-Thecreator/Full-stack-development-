An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware


Application level middleware:
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})
